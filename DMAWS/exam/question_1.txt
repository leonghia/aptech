For a retail company looking to build an online ordering and shopping website with varying demand over time, Microsoft Azure offers a range of services that can cater to the scalability, cost-efficiency, and reliability requirements. Here are three reasons to choose Azure for this scenario:

1. **Azure App Service:**
   - *Scalability:* Azure App Service allows you to easily scale your web applications up or down based on demand. You can use the Autoscale feature to automatically adjust the number of compute resources to handle increased traffic during peak times (e.g., Black Friday) and scale down during quieter periods. This ensures that you only pay for the resources you need when you need them, optimizing cost-efficiency.

   - *Ease of Development and Deployment:* Azure App Service supports multiple programming languages and provides built-in DevOps capabilities. This makes it easier for developers to build and deploy applications rapidly, reducing development time and costs. The company can take advantage of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline the release process.

   - *Managed Service:* Azure App Service is a fully managed platform, which means Microsoft handles the infrastructure management, patching, and maintenance tasks. This allows the retail company to focus on developing and enhancing the features of their online shopping platform without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

2. **Azure SQL Database:**
   - *Scalable and Cost-Efficient Database Solution:* Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service that offers built-in scalability features. You can easily adjust the database resources to handle varying loads, ensuring optimal performance during peak shopping seasons. Azure SQL Database's serverless tier is particularly cost-effective for sporadic or unpredictable workloads, as you only pay for the resources consumed per second.

   - *Security and Compliance:* Azure SQL Database provides robust security features to protect sensitive customer data. It supports encryption at rest and in transit, along with features like Azure Active Directory authentication. This is crucial for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and maintaining customer trust.

   - *Geo-Replication:* Azure SQL Database allows you to set up geo-replication for disaster recovery and improved availability. This ensures that even if one region experiences issues, the online shopping platform can continue to operate from another region, enhancing reliability.

3. **Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN):**
   - *Performance and User Experience:* Azure CDN improves the website's performance by caching content at edge locations worldwide. This reduces latency for users, ensuring faster page load times. As the demand for online shopping varies across the United States, having content distributed closer to users helps provide a consistent and responsive user experience.

   - *Cost Savings:* Azure CDN optimizes bandwidth usage and reduces server load by serving cached content from edge locations. This results in cost savings for data transfer and reduces the load on the origin server. Additionally, Azure CDN integrates seamlessly with Azure services, simplifying the configuration and management of content delivery.

   - *Global Reach:* Azure CDN has a vast network of edge locations globally. This is advantageous for a retail company with a nationwide presence, as it ensures that users from different regions experience low-latency access to the online shopping platform, contributing to a positive user experience.

By leveraging Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Content Delivery Network, the retail company can build a scalable, cost-efficient, and reliable online ordering and shopping website that can adapt to changing demand patterns while minimizing construction, operating, and maintenance costs.
