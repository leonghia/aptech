(1, 'Golden Gate Bridge', '1933-01-05', '2737.00', '27.00', '67.00', 'United States', 'San Francisco', 'The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, California—the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula—to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. It also carries pedestrian and bicycle traffic, and is designated as part of U.S. Bicycle Route 95. Being declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers,[7] the bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco and California. It was initially designed by engineer Joseph Strauss in 1917. The bridge was named for the Golden Gate strait, the channel that it spans.[8]\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is described in Frommer\'s travel guide as \"possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world.\"[9][10] At the time of its opening in 1937, it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world, titles it held until 1964 and 1998 respectively. Its main span is 4,200 feet (1,280 m) and total height is 746 feet (227 m).[11]', 'Before the bridge was built, the only practical short route between San Francisco and what is now Marin County was by boat across a section of San Francisco Bay. A ferry service began as early as 1820, with a regularly scheduled service beginning in the 1840s for the purpose of transporting water to San Francisco.[12]\n\nThe Sausalito Land and Ferry Company service, launched in 1867, eventually became the Golden Gate Ferry Company, a Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the largest ferry operation in the world by the late 1920s.[12][13] Once for railroad passengers and customers only, Southern Pacific\'s automobile ferries became very profitable and important to the regional economy.[14] The ferry crossing between the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco and Sausalito Ferry Terminal in Marin County took approximately 20 minutes and cost $1.00 per vehicle,[when?] a price later reduced to compete with the new bridge.[15][better source needed] The trip from the San Francisco Ferry Building took 27 minutes.\n\nMany wanted to build a bridge to connect San Francisco to Marin County. San Francisco was the largest American city still served primarily by ferry boats. Because it did not have a permanent link with communities around the bay, the city\'s growth rate was below the national average.[16] Many experts said that a bridge could not be built across the 6,700-foot (2,000-metre) strait, which had strong, swirling tides and currents, with water 372 ft (113 m) deep[17] at the center of the channel, and frequent strong winds. Experts said that ferocious winds and blinding fogs would prevent construction and operation.[16]', 'Although the idea of a bridge spanning the Golden Gate was not new, the proposal that eventually took hold was made in a 1916 San Francisco Bulletin article by former engineering student James Wilkins.[18] San Francisco\'s City Engineer estimated the cost at $100 million (equivalent to $2.5 billion today), and impractical for the time. He asked bridge engineers whether it could be built for less.[12] One who responded, Joseph Strauss, was an ambitious engineer and poet who had, for his graduate thesis, designed a 55-mile-long (89 km) railroad bridge across the Bering Strait.[19] At the time, Strauss had completed some 400 drawbridges—most of which were inland—and nothing on the scale of the new project.[3] Strauss\'s initial drawings[18] were for a massive cantilever on each side of the strait, connected by a central suspension segment, which Strauss promised could be built for $17 million (equivalent to $423 million today).[12]\n\nLocal authorities agreed to proceed only on the assurance that Strauss would alter the design and accept input from several consulting project experts.[citation needed] A suspension-bridge design was considered the most practical, because of recent advances in metallurgy.[12]\n\nStrauss spent more than a decade drumming up support in Northern California.[20] The bridge faced opposition, including litigation, from many sources. The Department of War was concerned that the bridge would interfere with ship traffic. The US Navy feared that a ship collision or sabotage to the bridge could block the entrance to one of its main harbors. Unions demanded guarantees that local workers would be favored for construction jobs. Southern Pacific Railroad, one of the most powerful business interests in California, opposed the bridge as competition to its ferry fleet and filed a lawsuit against the project, leading to a mass boycott of the ferry service.[12]\n\nIn May 1924, Colonel Herbert Deakyne held the second hearing on the Bridge on behalf of the Secretary of War in a request to use federal land for construction. Deakyne, on behalf of the Secretary of War, approved the transfer of land needed for the bridge structure and leading roads to the \"Bridging the Golden Gate Association\" and both San Francisco County and Marin County, pending further bridge plans by Strauss.[21] Another ally was the fledgling automobile industry, which supported the development of roads and bridges to increase demand for automobiles.[15]\n\nThe bridge\'s name was first used when the project was initially discussed in 1917 by M.M. O\'Shaughnessy, city engineer of San Francisco, and Strauss. The name became official with the passage of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District Act by the state legislature in 1923, creating a special district to design, build and finance the bridge.[22] San Francisco and most of the counties along the North Coast of California joined the Golden Gate Bridge District, with the exception being Humboldt County, whose residents opposed the bridge\'s construction and the traffic it would generate.[23]', 'Strauss was the chief engineer in charge of the overall design and construction of the bridge project.[16] However, because he had little understanding or experience with cable-suspension designs,[24] responsibility for much of the engineering and architecture fell on other experts. Strauss\'s initial design proposal (two double cantilever spans linked by a central suspension segment) was unacceptable from a visual standpoint. The final graceful suspension design was conceived and championed by Leon Moisseiff, the engineer of the Manhattan Bridge in New York City.[25]\n\nIrving Morrow, a relatively unknown residential architect, designed the overall shape of the bridge towers, the lighting scheme, and Art Deco elements, such as the tower decorations, streetlights, railing, and walkways. The famous International Orange color was Morrow\'s personal selection, winning out over other possibilities, including the US Navy\'s suggestion that it be painted with black and yellow stripes to ensure visibility by passing ships.[16][26]\n\nSenior engineer Charles Alton Ellis, collaborating remotely with Moisseiff, was the principal engineer of the project.[27] Moisseiff produced the basic structural design, introducing his \"deflection theory\" by which a thin, flexible roadway would flex in the wind, greatly reducing stress by transmitting forces via suspension cables to the bridge towers.[27] Although the Golden Gate Bridge design has proved sound, a later Moisseiff design, the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, collapsed in a strong windstorm soon after it was completed, because of an unexpected aeroelastic flutter.[28] Ellis was also tasked with designing a \"bridge within a bridge\" in the southern abutment, to avoid the need to demolish Fort Point, a pre–Civil War masonry fortification viewed, even then, as worthy of historic preservation. He penned a graceful steel arch spanning the fort and carrying the roadway to the bridge\'s southern anchorage.[29]', NULL, '../../assets/images/2023-02/the-golden-gate-bridge-1.jpg', 'North America', 'Steel', 'Suspension', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3151.7240195231543!2d-122.48044914877752!3d37.81993281723296!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x808586deffffffc3%3A0xcded139783705509!2sGolden%20Gate%20Bridge!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1678191364111!5m2!1sen!2s'),

It is part of the Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway, and crosses the busy and turbulent Akashi Strait (Akashi Kaikyō in Japanese). It was completed in 1998,[1] and has the second longest central span of any suspension bridge in the world,[3] at 1,991 metres (6,532 ft), only behind the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge that was opened in March 2022.\n\nIt is one of the key links of the Honshū–Shikoku Bridge Project, which created three routes across the Inland Sea.', 'The Akashi Kaikyo Bridge forms part of the Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway, the easternmost route of the bridge system linking the islands of Honshu and Shikoku.[4] The bridge crosses the Akashi Strait (width 4 km) between Kobe on Honshu and Iwaya on Awaji Island; the other major part of the crossing is completed by the Ōnaruto Bridge, which links Awaji Island to Ōge Island across the Naruto Strait.[4]\n\nBefore the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge was built, ferries carried passengers across the Akashi Strait. A major passageway for shipping, it is also known for its gale, heavy rain, storms, and natural disasters.[5] The Sekirei Maru sinking [ja] in 1945, which killed 304 people, first stirred public discussion on the possibility of a bridge over the span. In 1955, two ferries sank in the Shiun Maru disaster during a storm, killing 168 people. The ensuing shock and public outrage convinced the Japanese government to develop plans for a bridge to cross the strait.[6]', 'The original plan called for a mixed railway-road bridge, but when construction on the bridge began in April 1988, the construction was restricted to road only, with six lanes. Actual construction did not begin until May 1988 and involved more than 100 contractors.[8] The Great Hanshin Earthquake in January 1995 did not do substantial damage to the bridge due to anti-seismic building methods.[4] Construction was finished on time in September 1996.[9][10] The bridge was opened for traffic on April 5, 1998, in a ceremony officiated by the Crown Prince Naruhito and his spouse Crown Princess Masako of Japan along with Construction Minister Tsutomu Kawara.[8]', 'The bridge has four substructures: two main piers (located beneath the water) and two anchorages (on land). These are denoted 1A, 2P, 3P, and 4A in sequence from the Kobe side. 1A consists of an underground circular retaining wall filled with roller-compacted concrete, 2P and 3P are circular underwater spread-foundation caisson structures, and 4A is a rectangular direct foundation.[4] 2P is located at the edge of the sea plateau at a level depth of 40–50 m and a bearing depth of 60 m, and 3P is located at the symmetrical point to 2P with respect to the bridge\'s center, at a level depth of 36–39 m and a bearing depth of 57 m.[4]\n\nThe towers are located in an area of strong tidal currents where water velocity exceeds 7 knots (about 3.6 m/s). The selected scour protection measure includes the installation of a filtering layer with a thickness of 2 m in a range of 10 m around the caisson, covered with rip raps of 8 m thick.[11]', NULL, '../../assets/images/2023-02/akashi-kaikyo-bridge-1.jpg', 'Asia', 'Steel', 'Suspension', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3283.4735041932868!2d135.01948105116134!3d34.6174726950822!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6000824134f53bcd%3A0xaeaac1c733d78c3f!2sAkashi-Kaikyo%20Bridge!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1678192486267!5m2!1sen!2s'),
(3, 'Sunshine Skyway Bridge', '1982-01-01', '6663.00', '29.00', '55.00', 'United States', 'Florida', 'The Bob Graham Sunshine Skyway Bridge, often referred to as the Sunshine Skyway Bridge or the Sunshine Skyway, consists of a pair of long beam bridges with a central cable-stayed bridge that spans Lower Tampa Bay to connect St. Petersburg, Florida to Terra Ceia. The current Sunshine Skyway opened in 1987 and is the second bridge of that name on the site. It was designed by the Figg & Muller Engineering Group and built by the American Bridge Company.[10] The bridge is considered the flagship bridge of Florida and serves as a gateway to Tampa Bay.[11] The four-lane bridge carries Interstate 275 and U.S. Route 19, passing through Pinellas County, Hillsborough County and Manatee County. It is a toll road, with a $1.50 toll assessed on two-axle vehicles traveling in either direction and collected via cash or the state\'s SunPass system.[12]\n\nThe original Sunshine Skyway was a two-lane beam bridge with a central truss bridge built directly to the west of the current structure. It was completed in 1954, and a second span was added in 1971.[13]\n\nThe original Skyway was the site of two major maritime disasters over a four-month period, the second of which resulted in the bridge\'s partial destruction and eventual replacement. On the night of January 28, 1980, the United States Coast Guard Cutter Blackthorn collided with the tanker Capricorn just west of the bridge, resulting in the sinking of the cutter with the loss of 23 crew members in the worst peacetime disaster in the history of the US Coast Guard. On the morning of May 9, 1980, the freighter MV Summit Venture collided with a support pier near the center of the bridge during a sudden squall, resulting in the catastrophic failure of the southbound roadway and the deaths of 35 people when several vehicles (including a Greyhound Bus) plunged into Tampa Bay.[14] Within a few years, the damaged span was partially demolished, the surviving span was partially demolished and converted into a long fishing pier, and the modern Sunshine Skyway was built. The current bridge incorporates numerous safety features designed to protect the structure from ship collisions, as it spans one of the busiest shipping lanes in the United States.', 'In 1924, J.G. \"Jim\" Foley, a realtor, and his partner Charles R. Carter joined with James E. Bussey, an attorney, to create the Bee Line Ferry Company. The service started on March 7, 1927, and originally had two ferries: Fred D. Doty and the City of Wilmington (which was later renamed Pinellas). The ferry crossed from the end of Bay Vista Park in St. Petersburg and went to Piney Point on the other side of the bay.[15]\n\nA physiotherapist from St. Petersburg named Herman Simmonds proposed building a \"high-level suspension bridge\" in 1926.[8] Sometime during 1927, Simmonds received congressional approval and a permit from the US War Department to build a bridge. However, efforts were put on hold due to the Great Depression.[16]\n\nThe Florida State Legislature gave the Bee Line Ferry a franchise for 50 years to operate it in 1929.[17] Another unsuccessful proposal to build a crossing would occur in 1929 when a bill was introduced into the state legislature to build a tunnel crossing lower Tampa Bay running from Pinellas Point to Piney Point. With the tunnel itself being buried 40 feet (12 m) under the bay and going for a length of 1,000 feet (300 m). However this proposal was not successful in the end with unspecified \"Tampa officials\" arguing that any bridge or tunnel would be a navigational hazard during periods of war time.[18]\n\nThe ferry service continued to expand with the Fred D. Doty being replaced by another ferry called the Manatee in 1932. A fourth vessel, the Sarasota was bought and put into service in 1937. Ferries departed every 30 minutes between 7:30 am and 9 pm during the winter. In the summer, they departed every 45 minutes.[15] The ferry company ceased operating when the US federal government confiscated the boats as they needed them for the World War II war effort in 1942.[19]\n\nAt close to the same time when the proposal from Simmonds ended, another proposal originating from Louis E. Saupe emerged. Saupe who was the head of the West Coast Bridge and Tunnel Co. wanted a combination of a causeway and a tunnel. The causeway portion would go from Maximo Point to Mullet Key while the tunnel portion would run for less than a 1/2 mile before transitioning to a causeway until reaching Terra Ceia. Pinellas County commissioners liked the idea and agreed to it. In 1939 they pushed state officials to approve it and the state legislature agreed to back it. Since the bridge would cross into part of Hillsborough County, which was not included in the bill for the bridge, it was declared unconstitutional.[20]\n\nIn 1944, the St. Petersburg Port Authority bought the franchise from the company that operated the ferry. They continued to operate the ferry until the opening of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.[16]\n\nBail, Horton, and Associates along with Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hogan & Macdonald received a contract from the port authority on December 20, 1944, to design the bridge. Both firms released a report in November 1945 about the bridge.[19] Freeman Horton of Bail, Horton and Associates proposed Snead Island as its southern terminus and 10th Street in Palmetto be the thoroughfare.[21] Bail, Horton, and Associates was awarded the contract but as it was unable to get $10 million in revenue bonds, the state government halted the project sometime during the late 1940s. The design competition was reactivated again in the early 1950s with Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hogan & Macdonald getting the contract this time[19] and they ended up serving as the engineers for construction and design. The partner-in-charge for Brinckerhoff was M. N. Quade. The successful attempt for building the bridge came after the Florida State Improvement Commission was approached with a proposal that they finance it while the State Road Department (SRD) built it. The Florida\'s State Improvement Commission proceeded to at some point take over the St. Petersburg Port Authority\'s assets which included $520,000 seen with bonded indebtedness. A $21,250,000 bond issue was passed by the Improvement Commission and sales started after the Port Authority\'s assets were acquired.[22]', 'On July 4, 1950, a day-long celebration was held in St. Petersburg called \"Spans Across the Bay\". The name of the bridge was announced that day being the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. The name was submitted by Virginia Seymore of Indian Rocks, Florida as part of a national contest to give the bridge a name with 20,000 entries being submitted.[16] The contest was held by the St. Pete Junior Chamber of Commerce and the State Road Department. Names that were prohibited would be those that referred to a person\'s name or a geographic place.[13] Construction bids began to be accepted during that day as well.[16] Construction started on October 19, 1950[8] with 544 people helping to build the bridge in total.[13] It was built by the Virginia Bridge Company[23] and another firm that was involved doing engineering work was Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hall and McDonald.[24] Staging areas for the construction of the bridge were established at both crossing sites. An entire concrete factory was established near Piney Point while prefabricated concrete parts were delivered via barge from a site in Tampa where they were made.[16] 4,100,000 cubic yards of material would be dredged as part of building the causeways for the bridge. To physically build the bridge: 12,104,000 pounds (5,490,000 kg) of structural steel, 8,536,700 pounds (3,872,200 kg) of rebar and 115,980 cubic yards of concrete would be used.[13]', 'Strauss was the chief engineer in charge of the overall design and construction of the bridge project.

He penned a graceful steel arch spanning the fort and carrying the roadway to the bridge\'s southern anchorage.\r\n\r\nEllis was a Greek scholar and mathematician who at one time was a University of Illinois professor of engineering despite having no engineering degree. He eventually earned a degree in civil engineering from the University of Illinois prior to designing the Golden Gate Bridge and spent the last twelve years of his career as a professor at Purdue University. He became an expert in structural design, writing the standard textbook of the time. Ellis did much of the technical and theoretical work that built the bridge, but he received none of the credit in his lifetime. In November 1931, Strauss fired Ellis and replaced him with a former subordinate, Clifford Paine, ostensibly for wasting too much money sending telegrams back and forth to Moisseiff. Ellis, obsessed with the project and unable to find work elsewhere during the Depression, continued working 70 hours per week on an unpaid basis, eventually turning in ten volumes of hand calculations.\r\n\r\nWith an eye toward self-promotion and posterity, Strauss downplayed the contributions of his collaborators who, despite receiving little recognition or compensation,[23] are largely responsible for the final form of the bridge. He succeeded in having himself credited as the person most responsible for the design and vision of the bridge. Only much later were the contributions of the others on the design team properly appreciated. In May 2007, the Golden Gate Bridge District issued a formal report on 70 years of stewardship of the famous bridge and decided to give Ellis major credit for the design of the bridge.', NULL, '../../assets/images/2023-02/sunshine-skyway-bridge-1.jpg', 'North America', 'Steel', 'Cable-stayed', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3535.122817299924!2d-82.65803584895117!3d27.620712635815558!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x88c31db3105de9a5%3A0x53e7724a2432b4a6!2sSunshine%20Skyway%20Bridge!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1678192611464!5m2!1sen!2s'),

The bridge was constructed to give better access to the East End of London, which had expanded its commercial potential in the 19th century. The bridge was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales in 1894.\n\nThe bridge is 800 feet (240 m) in length and consists of two 213-foot (65 m) bridge towers connected at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow shipping. Originally hydraulically powered, the operating mechanism was converted to an electro-hydraulic system in 1972. The bridge is part of the London Inner Ring Road and thus the boundary of the London congestion charge zone, and remains an important traffic route with 40,000 crossings every day. The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge\'s twin towers, high-level walkways, and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.\n\nTower Bridge has become a recognisable London landmark. It is sometimes confused with London Bridge, about 0.5 miles (800 m) upstream, which has led to a persistent urban legend about an American purchasing the wrong bridge.', 'In the late 19th century, commercial development in the East End of London increased, leading to demand for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by sailing ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London between London Bridge and the Tower of London.[2]\n\nA Special Bridge or Subway Committee chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman was formed in 1877 to find a solution.[3] More than fifty designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette, which was rejected because of a lack of sufficient headroom. A design was not approved until 1884 when it was decided to build a bascule bridge.[2][4] Sir John Wolfe Barry was appointed engineer and Sir Horace Jones the architect (who was also one of the judges).[5][6] An Act of Parliament authorising construction was passed in 1885. It specified that the opening span would provide a clear width of 200 feet (61 m) and headroom of 135 feet (41 m). The design had to be in a Gothic style.[5] Construction was funded by the Bridge House Estates, a charity established in 1282 for maintenance of London Bridge that subsequently expanded to cover Tower Bridge, Blackfriars Bridge, Southwark Bridge and the Millennium Bridge.[7]\n\nBarry designed a bridge with two bridge towers built on piers. The central span was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side spans were suspension bridges, with rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained in the bridge\'s upper walkways.[5]', 'Construction started in 1886, with the foundation stone laid by the Prince of Wales on 21 June, and took eight years.[8][9] Major contractors included Sir John Jackson (foundations),[10] Armstrong, Mitchell and Company (hydraulics), William Webster,[11] and Sir William Arrol & Co.[12] 432 people worked on the site; E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction.[13]\n\nTwo piers, containing over 70,000 long tons (78,400 short tons; 71,123 t) of concrete, were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction.[14] More than 11,000 long tons (12,320 short tons; 11,177 t) of steel were used in the framework for the towers and walkways, which were then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone to protect the underlying steelwork.[15]\n\nJones died in 1887, and George D. Stevenson took over the project.[16] Stevenson replaced Jones\'s original brick façade with the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which made the bridge a distinctive landmark and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby Tower of London.[13][16] The total cost of construction was £1,184,000[9][13] (equivalent to £143 million in 2021).[17]', 'The bridge is 800 feet (240 m) in length with two towers each 213 feet (65 m) high, built on piers.[43] The central span of 200 feet (61 m) between the towers is split into two equal bascules, or leaves, which can be raised to an angle of 86 degrees to allow river traffic to pass.[44] The bascules, weighing over 1,000 tons each, are counterbalanced to minimise the force required and allow raising in five minutes.[45]\n\nThe two side spans are suspension bridges, each 270 feet (82 m) long, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge\'s upper walkways. The pedestrian walkways are 143 feet (44 m) above the river at high tide and accessed by lifts and staircases.[5][13]\n\nOne of the chimneys on the bridge connects to an old fireplace in a guardroom of the Tower of London.

Completed in 1890, it is considered a symbol of Scotland (having been voted Scotland\'s greatest man-made wonder in 2016), and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[3] It was designed by English engineers Sir John Fowler and Sir Benjamin Baker.[4] It is sometimes referred to as the Forth Rail Bridge (to distinguish it from the adjacent Forth Road Bridge), although this has never been its official name.\n\nConstruction of the bridge began in 1882 and it was opened on 4 March 1890 by the Duke of Rothesay, the future Edward VII. The bridge carries the Edinburgh–Aberdeen line across the Forth between the villages of South Queensferry and North Queensferry and has a total length of 8,094 feet (2,467 m). When it opened it had the longest single cantilever bridge span in the world, until 1919 when the Quebec Bridge in Canada was completed. It continues to be the world\'s second-longest single cantilever span, with a span of 1,709 feet (521 m).\n\nThe bridge and its associated railway infrastructure are owned by Network Rail.[5]', 'Before the construction of the bridge, ferries were used to cross the Firth.[6] In 1806, a pair of tunnels, one for each direction, was proposed, and in 1818 James Anderson produced a design for a three-span suspension bridge close to the site of the present one.[7] Calling for approximately 2,500 tonnes (2,500 long tons; 2,800 short tons) of iron, Wilhelm Westhofen said of it \"and this quantity [of iron] distributed over the length would have given it a very light and slender appearance, so light indeed that on a dull day it would hardly have been visible, and after a heavy gale probably no longer to be seen on a clear day either\".[8]\n\n\nClose up on the base of one of the three double-cantilevers of the bridge\nFor the railway age, Thomas Bouch designed for the Edinburgh and Northern Railway a roll-on/roll-off ferry between Granton and Burntisland that opened in 1850, which proved so successful that another was ordered for the Tay.[9] In late 1863, a joint project between the North British Railway and Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, which would merge in 1865, appointed Stephenson and Toner to design a bridge for the Forth, but the commission was given to Bouch around six months later.[10]\n\nIt had proven difficult to engineer a suspension bridge that was able to carry railway traffic, and Thomas Bouch, engineer to the North British Railway (NBR) and Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, was in 1863–1864 working on a single-track girder bridge crossing the Forth near Charlestown, where the river is around 2 miles (3.2 km) wide, but mostly relatively shallow.[10][11] The promoters, however, were concerned about the ability to set foundations in the silty river bottom, as borings had gone as deep as 231 feet (70 m) into the mud without finding any rock, but Bouch conducted experiments to demonstrate that it was possible for the silt to support considerable weight.[12] Experiments in late 1864 with weighted caissons achieved a pressure of 5 t/sq ft (4.9 long ton/sq ft; 5.5 short ton/sq ft) on the silt, encouraging Bouch to continue with the design.[12] In August 1865, Richard Hodgson, chairman of the NBR, proposed that the company invest £18,000 to try a different kind of foundation, as the weighted caissons had not been successful.[13] Bouch proposed using a large pine platform underneath the piers, 80 by 60 by 7 feet (24.4 m × 18.3 m × 2.1 m) (the original design called for a 114 by 80 by 9 feet (34.7 m × 24.4 m × 2.7 m) platform of green beech) weighed down with 10,000 tonnes (9,800 long tons; 11,000 short tons) of pig iron which would sink the wooden platform to the level of the silt.[12] The platform was launched on 14 June 1866 after some difficulty in getting it to move down the greased planks it rested on, and then moored in the harbour for six weeks pending completion.[12][14] The bridge project was aborted just before the platform was sunk as the NBR expected to lose \"through traffic\" following the amalgamation of the Caledonian Railway and the Scottish North Eastern Railway.[12] In September 1866, a committee of shareholders investigating rumours of financial difficulties found that accounts had been falsified, and the chairman and the entire board had resigned by November.[15] By mid-1867 the NBR was nearly bankrupt, and all work on the Forth and Tay bridges was stopped.[16]', 'The Bill for the construction of the bridge was passed on 19 May 1882 after an eight-day enquiry, the only objections being from rival railway companies.[38] On 21 December, the contract was let to Sir Thomas Tancred, Mr. T. H. Falkiner and Mr. Joseph Philips, civil engineers and contractor, and Sir William Arrol & Co.[39] Arrol was a self-made man, who had been apprenticed to a blacksmith at the age of thirteen before going on to have a highly successful business.[40] Tancred was a professional engineer who had worked with Arrol before, but he would leave the partnership during the course of construction.[41]\n\nThe steel was produced by Frederick and William Siemens (England) and Pierre and Emile Martin (France). Following advances in furnace design by the Siemens brothers and improvements by the Martin brothers, the process of manufacture enabled high quality steel to be produced very quickly.[42][43][44]', 'The bridge spans the Forth between the villages of South Queensferry and North Queensferry and has a total length of 8,094 feet (2,467 m)[1] with the double track elevated 150 feet (45.72 m) above the water level at high tide. It consists of two main spans of 1,700 feet (518.16 m), two side spans of 680 ft (207.3 m), and 15 approach spans of 168 ft (51.2 m).[1][23] Each main span consists of two 680 ft (207.3 m) cantilever arms supporting a central 350 feet (106.7 m) span truss. The weight of the bridge superstructure was 50,513 long tons (51,324 t), including the 6.5 million rivets used.[23] The bridge also used 640,000 cubic feet (18,122 m3) of granite.[24]\n\nThe three great four-tower cantilever structures are 361 feet (110.03 m) tall,[1] each tower resting on a separate granite pier. These were constructed using 70 ft (21 m) diameter caissons; those for the north cantilever and two on the small uninhabited island of Inchgarvie acted as cofferdams, while the remaining two on Inchgarvie and those for the south cantilever, where the river bed was 91 ft (28 m) below high-water level, used compressed air to keep water out of the working chamber at the base.[25]', NULL, '../../assets/images/2023-02/firth-of-forth-bridge-1.jpg', 'Europe', 'Steel', 'Cantilever', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d71353.19359259566!2d-3.369992224260591!3d56.022356001382114!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x4887c8d4e71eb19d%3A0x353e283c7622e337!2sFirth%20of%20Forth!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1678192796615!5m2!1sen!2s'),
(6, 'Brooklyn Bridge', '1869-01-01', '1834.00', '26.00', '39.00', 'United States', 'New York', 'The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge in New York City, spanning the East River between the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Opened on May 24, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first fixed crossing of the East River. It was also the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its opening, with a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 m) and a deck 127 ft (38.7 m) above mean high water. The span was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge or the East River Bridge but was officially renamed the Brooklyn Bridge in 1915.\n\nProposals for a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn were first made in the early 19th century, which eventually led to the construction of the current span, designed by John A. Roebling. The project\'s chief engineer, his son Washington Roebling, contributed further design work, assisted by the latter\'s wife, Emily Warren Roebling. Construction started in 1870, with the Tammany Hall-controlled New York Bridge Company overseeing construction, although numerous controversies and the novelty of the design prolonged the project over thirteen years. Since opening, the Brooklyn Bridge has undergone several reconfigurations, having carried horse-drawn vehicles and elevated railway lines until 1950. To alleviate increasing traffic flows, additional bridges and tunnels were built across the East River. Following gradual deterioration, the Brooklyn Bridge has been renovated several times, including in the 1950s, 1980s, and 2010s.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge is the southernmost of the four toll-free vehicular bridges connecting Manhattan Island and Long Island, with the Manhattan Bridge, the Williamsburg Bridge, and the Queensboro Bridge to the north. Only passenger vehicles and pedestrian and bicycle traffic are permitted. A major tourist attraction since its opening, the Brooklyn Bridge has become an icon of New York City. Over the years, the bridge has been used as the location of various stunts and performances, as well as several crimes and attacks. The Brooklyn Bridge has been designated a National Historic Landmark, a New York City landmark, and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.', 'Proposals for a bridge between the then-separate cities of Brooklyn and New York had been suggested as early as 1800.[56][39] At the time, the only travel between the two cities was by a number of ferry lines.[56][57] Engineers presented various designs, such as chain or link bridges, though these were never built because of the difficulties of constructing a high enough fixed-span bridge across the extremely busy East River.[56][39] There were also proposals for tunnels under the East River, but these were considered prohibitively expensive.[58] The current Brooklyn Bridge was conceived by German immigrant John Augustus Roebling in 1852. He had previously designed and constructed shorter suspension bridges, such as Roebling\'s Delaware Aqueduct in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, and the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Covington, Kentucky.[59]\n\nIn February 1867, the New York State Senate passed a bill that allowed the construction of a suspension bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan.[60] Two months later, the New York and Brooklyn Bridge Company was incorporated with a board of directors (later converted to a board of trustees).[56][61][62] There were twenty trustees in total: eight each appointed by the mayors of New York and Brooklyn, as well as the mayors of each city and the auditor and comptroller of Brooklyn.[38] The company was tasked with constructing what was then known as the New York and Brooklyn Bridge.[56][61][62] Alternatively, the span was just referred to as the \"Brooklyn Bridge\", a name originating in a January 25, 1867, letter to the editor sent to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle.[63] The act of incorporation, which became law on April 16, 1867, authorized the cities of New York (now Manhattan) and Brooklyn to subscribe to $5 million in capital stock, which would fund the bridge\'s construction.[58]', 'Construction of the Brooklyn Bridge began on January 2, 1870.[38] The first work entailed the construction of two caissons, upon which the suspension towers would be built.[53][5] The Brooklyn side\'s caisson was built at the Webb & Bell shipyard in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and was launched into the river on March 19, 1870.[53][5] Compressed air was pumped into the caisson, and workers entered the space to dig the sediment until it sank to the bedrock. As one sixteen-year-old from Ireland, Frank Harris, described the fearful experience:[77]\n\nThe six of us were working naked to the waist in the small iron chamber with the temperature of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit: In five minutes the sweat was pouring from us, and all the while we were standing in icy water that was only kept from rising by the terrific pressure. No wonder the headaches were blinding.[77]\n\nOnce the caisson had reached the desired depth, it was to be filled in with vertical brick piers and concrete.[78][79] However, due to the unexpectedly high concentration of large boulders atop the riverbed, the Brooklyn caisson took several months to sink to the desired depth.[79][5] Furthermore, in December 1870, its timber roof caught fire, delaying construction further.[80][81] The \"Great Blowout\", as the fire was called, delayed construction for several months, since the holes in the caisson had to be repaired.[82] On March 6, 1871, the repairs were finished, and the caisson had reached its final depth of 44.5 feet (13.6 m); it was filled with concrete five days later.[82][5] Overall, about 264 individuals were estimated to have worked in the caisson every day, but because of high worker turnover, the final total was thought to be about 2,500 men in total.[83] In spite of this, only a few workers were paralyzed. At its final depth, the caisson\'s air pressure was 21 pounds per square inch (140 kPa).[84]\n\nThe Manhattan side\'s caisson was the next structure to be built. To ensure that it would not catch fire like its counterpart had, the Manhattan caisson was lined with fireproof plate iron.[55] It was launched from Webb & Bell\'s shipyard on May 11, 1871,[85][42] and maneuvered into place that September.[86][53] Due to the extreme underwater air pressure inside the much deeper Manhattan caisson, many workers became sick with \"the bends\"—decompression sickness—during this work,[77] despite the incorporation of airlocks (which were believed to help with decompression sickness at the time).[87][88] This condition was unknown at the time and was first called \"caisson disease\" by the project physician, Andrew Smith.[89][90] Between January 25 and May 31, 1872, Smith treated 110 cases of decompression sickness, while three workers died from the disease.[42] When iron probes underneath the Manhattan caisson found the bedrock to be even deeper than expected, Washington Roebling halted construction due to the increased risk of decompression sickness.[42][91] After the Manhattan caisson reached a depth of 78.5 feet (23.9 m) with an air pressure of 35 pounds per square inch (240 kPa),[84] Washington deemed the sandy subsoil overlying the bedrock 30 feet (9.1 m) beneath to be sufficiently firm, and subsequently infilled the caisson with concrete in July 1872.[42][92]\n\nWashington Roebling himself suffered a paralyzing injury as a result of caisson disease shortly after ground was broken for the Brooklyn tower foundation.[39][93] His debilitating condition left him unable to supervise the construction in person, so he designed the caissons and other equipment from his apartment, directing \"the completion of the bridge through a telescope from his bedroom.\"[77] His wife, Emily Warren Roebling, not only provided written communications between her husband and the engineers on site,[94] but also understood mathematics, calculations of catenary curves, strengths of materials, bridge specifications, and the intricacies of cable construction. She spent the next 11 years helping supervise the bridge\'s construction,[84][95] taking over much of the chief engineer\'s duties, including day-to-day supervision and project management.[96]', 'The first major upgrade to the Brooklyn Bridge commenced in 1948, when a contract for redesigning the roadways were awarded to David B. Steinman.[204][205] The renovation was expected to double the capacity of the bridge\'s roadways to nearly 6,000 cars per hour,[204] at a projected cost of $7 million.[206] The renovation included the demolition of both the elevated and the trolley tracks on the roadways, the removal of trusses separating the inner elevated tracks from the existing vehicle lanes and the widening of each roadway from two to three lanes,[206][207] as well as the construction of a new steel-and-concrete floor.[208] In addition, new ramps were added to Adams Street, Cadman Plaza, and the Brooklyn Queens Expressway (BQE) on the Brooklyn side, and to Park Row on the Manhattan side.[209] The trolley tracks closed in March 1950 to allow for the widening work to occur.[210][211] During the construction project, one roadway at a time was closed, allowing reduced traffic flows to cross the bridge in one direction only.[212] The widened south roadway was completed in May 1951,[213] followed by the north roadway in October 1953.[214] The restoration was finished in May 1954 with the completion of the reconstructed elevated promenade.[215][212]\n\nWhile the rebuilding of the span was ongoing, a fallout shelter was constructed beneath the Manhattan approach in anticipation of the Cold War. The abandoned space in one of the masonry arches was stocked with emergency survival supplies for a potential nuclear attack by the Soviet Union; these supplies remained in place half a century later.[216] In addition, defensive barriers were added to the bridge as a safeguard against sabotage.[217]\n\nSimultaneous with the rebuilding of the Brooklyn Bridge, a double-decked viaduct for the BQE was being built through an existing steel overpass of the bridge\'s Brooklyn approach ramp.[218] The segment of the BQE from Brooklyn Bridge south to Atlantic Avenue opened in June 1954,[219] but the direct ramp from the northbound BQE to the Manhattan-bound Brooklyn Bridge did not open until 1959.[220] The city also widened the Adams Street approach in Brooklyn, between the bridge and Fulton Street, from 60 to 160 feet (18 to 49 m) between 1954 and 1955.[221][222] Subsequently, Boerum Place from Fulton Street south to Atlantic Avenue was also widened.[223] This required the demolition of the old Kings County courthouse.[224] The towers were cleaned in 1958[225] and the Brooklyn anchorage was repaired the next year.[226]\n\nOn the Manhattan side, the city approved a controversial rebuilding of the Manhattan entrance plaza in 1953. The project, which would add a grade-separated junction over Park Row, was hotly contested because it would require the demolition of 21 structures, including the old New York World Building.[227] The reconstruction also necessitated the relocation of 410 families on Park Row.[228] In December 1956, the city started a two-year renovation of the plaza. This required the closure of one roadway at a time, as was done during the rebuilding of the bridge itself.[229] Work on redeveloping the area around the Manhattan approach started in the mid-1960s.[230] At the same time, plans were announced for direct ramps to the FDR Drive elevated highway to alleviate congestion at the approach.[231] The ramp from the FDR Drive to the Brooklyn Bridge was opened in 1968,[232] followed by the ramp from the bridge to the FDR Drive the next year.[233] A single ramp from the Manhattan-bound Brooklyn Bridge to northbound Park Row was constructed in 1970.[234] A repainting of the bridge was announced two years later in advance of its 90th anniversary.[235]', NULL, '../../assets/images/2023-02/brooklyn-bridge-1.jpg', 'North America', 'Granite', 'Suspension', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3024.5542644858697!2d-73.99816759871777!3d40.70581344582887!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x89c25a2343ce7b2b%3A0x2526ddba7abd465c!2sBrooklyn%20Bridge!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1678192888950!5m2!1sen!2s');

(7, 'Chesapeake Bay Bridge - Tunnel', '1960-10-26', '28300.00', '7.00', '12.00', 'United States', 'Virginia', 'The Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel (CBBT, officially the Lucius J. Kellam Jr. Bridge–Tunnel) is a 17.6-mile (28.3 km) bridge–tunnel that crosses the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay between Delmarva and Hampton Roads in the U.S. state of Virginia. It opened in 1964, replacing ferries that had operated since the 1930s. A major project to dualize its bridges was completed in 1999, and a similar project to dualize one of its tunnels is currently underway.[2]\n\nWith 12 miles (19 km) of bridges and two one-mile-long (1.6 km) tunnels, the CBBT[1] is one of only 14 bridge–tunnel systems in the world and one of three in Hampton Roads. The bridge is the longest in terms of overall length in the United States to not be located in the state of Louisiana. It carries US 13, which saves motorists roughly 95 miles (153 km) and 1+1⁄2 hours on trips between Hampton Roads and the Delaware Valley compared with other routes through the Washington–Baltimore Metropolitan Area. As of January 2021, over 140 million vehicles have crossed the CBBT.[3]\n\nThe CBBT was built and is operated by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel District, a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia governed by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel Commission in cooperation with the Virginia Department of Transportation. Its construction was financed by toll revenue bonds, while operating and maintenance expenses are recovered through tolls. In 2002, a Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) study commissioned by the Virginia General Assembly concluded that \"given the inability of the state to fund future capital requirements of the CBBT, the District and Commission should be retained to operate and maintain the Bridge–Tunnel as a toll facility in perpetuity\".\n\nThe CBBT is often confused with the similarly named Chesapeake Bay Bridge, which crosses the Chesapeake Bay farther north in Maryland in Annapolis, near the United States Naval Academy.', 'In December 1606, the Virginia Company of London sent an expedition to North America to establish a settlement in the Colony of Virginia. After sailing across the Atlantic Ocean from England, they reached the New World at the southern edge of the mouth of what is now known as the Chesapeake Bay.[4] They named the two flanking Virginia points of land /capes like gateposts at the entrance to the long extensive estuary after the sons of their king, James I, the southern Cape Henry, for the eldest and presumed heir, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, and the northern Cape Charles, for his younger brother, Charles, Duke of York (the future King Charles I). A few weeks later they established their first permanent settlement on the southern, mainland, side of the bay, several miles upstream along the newly named James River at Jamestown on the northern shore on a close-in island for protection, the first permanent settlement in English North America.\n\nAcross the bay, the area north of Cape Charles was located along what became known later as the Delmarva Peninsula. As it bordered the Atlantic Ocean to its east, the region became known as Virginia and neighboring Maryland\'s Eastern Shore. As the entire colony grew, the bay was a formidable transportation obstacle for exchanges with the Virginia mainland on the Western Shore. One of the eight original shires of Virginia, Accomac Shire was established there in 1634, eventually becoming the two counties of modern times, Accomack County in the north and Northampton County to the south. In comparison to mainland regions, commerce and growth was limited by the need to cross the Bay. Consequently, little industrial base grew there, with the oceanfront peninsula staying predominantly rural with small towns and villages oriented towards life on the waters, and most residents made their living by farming and working as watermen, both on the bay (locally known as the \"bay side\") and in the Atlantic Ocean (\"sea side\").', 'In mid-1960, the Chesapeake Bay Ferry Commission sold $200 million in toll revenue bonds (equivalent to $1.42 billion in 2021 dollars) to private investors, and the proceeds were used to finance the construction of the bridge–tunnel. Funds collected by future tolls were pledged to pay the principal and interest on the bonds. No local, state, or federal tax funds were used in the construction of the project.\n\nConstruction contracts were awarded to a consortium of Tidewater Construction Corporation and Merritt-Chapman & Scott Corporation. The steel superstructure for the high-level bridges near the north end of the crossing were fabricated by the American Bridge Division of United States Steel Corporation. Construction of the bridge–tunnel began in October 1960 after a six-month process of assembling necessary equipment from worldwide sources.\n\nThe tunnels were constructed using the technique refined by Ole Singstad with the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, whereby a large ditch was first dug for each tunnel, into which was lowered pre-fabricated tunnel sections cable-suspended from overhead barges. Interior chambers were filled with water to lower the sections, the sections then aligned, bolted together by divers, the water pumped out, and the tunnels finally covered with earth.\n\nThe construction was accomplished under the severe conditions imposed by nor\'easters, hurricanes, and the unpredictable Atlantic Ocean. During the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962, much of the partially completed work and a major piece of custom-built equipment, a pile driver barge called \"The Big D\", were destroyed. Seven workers were killed at various times during the construction. In April 1964, 42 months after construction began, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel opened to traffic and the ferry service discontinued.\n\nThe Ferry Commission and transportation district it oversees, created in 1954, were later renamed for the revised mission of building and operating the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel. The CBBT district is a public agency, and it is a legal subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The bridge–tunnel is supported financially by the tolls collected from the motorists who use the facility.', 'In 1956, the General Assembly authorized the Ferry Commission to conduct feasibility studies for the construction of a fixed crossing. The conclusion of the study indicated that a vehicular crossing was feasible.[3]\n\nConsideration was given to service between the Eastern Shore and both the peninsula and South Hampton Roads. Eventually, the shortest route, extending between the Eastern Shore and a point in Princess Anne County at Chesapeake Beach (east of Little Creek, west of Lynnhaven Inlet), was selected. An option to also provide a fixed crossing link to Hampton and the peninsula was not pursued.[citation needed]\n\nThe selected route crosses two Atlantic shipping channels: the Thimble Shoals Channel to Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake Channel to the northern Chesapeake Bay. High-level bridges were initially considered for traversing these channels. The United States Navy objected to bridging the Thimble Shoals Channel because a bridge collapse (possibly by sabotage) could cut Naval Station Norfolk off from the Atlantic Ocean. Maryland officials expressed similar concerns about the Chesapeake Channel and the Port of Baltimore.[6]\n\nTo address these concerns, the engineers recommended a series of bridges and tunnels known as a bridge–tunnel, similar in design to the Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel, which had been completed in 1957, but a considerably longer and larger facility. The tunnel portions, anchored by four man-made islands of approximately five acres (2.0 ha) each, would be extended under the two main shipping channels. The CBBT was designed by the engineering firm Sverdrup & Parcel of St. Louis, Missouri.[6]', NULL, '../../assets/images/2023-02/chesapeake-bay-bridge-tunnel-1.jpg', 'North America', 'Steel', 'Fixed link', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3184.6503217280037!2d-76.07095134879295!3d37.04198306165243!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x89baf2f20a056083%3A0x794f18fcbb2680d4!2sChesapeake%20Bay%20Bridge-Tunnel%2C%20Virginia%2C%20USA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1678192946505!5m2!1sen!2s'),

The view of the bridge, the harbour, and the nearby Sydney Opera House is widely regarded as an iconic image of Sydney, and of Australia itself. Nicknamed \"The Coathanger\" because of its arch-based design, the bridge carries rail, vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic.[1][2]\n\nUnder the direction of John Bradfield of the New South Wales Department of Public Works, the bridge was designed and built by British firm Dorman Long of Middlesbrough, and opened in 1932.[3][4] The bridge\'s general design, which Bradfield tasked the NSW Department of Public Works with producing, was a rough copy of the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City. This general design document, however, did not form any part of the request for tender, which remained sufficiently broad as to allow cantilever (Bradfield\'s original preference) and even suspension bridge proposals. The design chosen from the tender responses was original work created by Dorman Long, who leveraged some of the design from its own Tyne Bridge which, though superficially similar, does not share the graceful flares at the ends of each arch which make the harbour bridge so distinctive.[5] It is the eighth longest spanning-arch bridge in the world and the tallest steel arch bridge, measuring 134 m (440 ft) from top to water level.[6] It was also the world\'s widest long-span bridge, at 48.8 m (160 ft) wide, until construction of the new Port Mann Bridge in Vancouver was completed in 2012.[7][8]', 'There had been plans to build a bridge as early as 1814, when convict and noted architect Francis Greenway reputedly proposed to Governor Lachlan Macquarie that a bridge be built from the northern to the southern shore of the harbour.[6][30] In 1825, Greenway wrote a letter to the then \"The Australian\" newspaper stating that such a bridge would \"give an idea of strength and magnificence that would reflect credit and glory on the colony and the Mother Country\".[30]\n\nNothing came of Greenway\'s suggestions, but the idea remained alive, and many further suggestions were made during the nineteenth century. In 1840, naval architect Robert Brindley proposed that a floating bridge be built. Engineer Peter Henderson produced one of the earliest known drawings of a bridge across the harbour around 1857. A suggestion for a truss bridge was made in 1879, and in 1880 a high-level bridge estimated at £850,000 was proposed.[30]\n\nIn 1900, the Lyne government committed to building a new Central railway station and organised a worldwide competition for the design and construction of a harbour bridge, overseen by Minister for Public Works Edward William O\'Sullivan.[31] Local engineer Norman Selfe submitted a design for a suspension bridge and won the second prize of £500. In 1902, when the outcome of the first competition became mired in controversy, Selfe won a second competition outright, with a design for a steel cantilever bridge. The selection board were unanimous, commenting that, \"The structural lines are correct and in true proportion, and... the outline is graceful\".[32] However due to an economic downturn and a change of government at the 1904 NSW State election construction never began.[citation needed]', 'Bradfield visited the site sporadically throughout the eight years it took Dorman Long to complete the bridge. Despite having originally championed a cantilever construction and the fact that his own arched general design was used in neither the tender process nor as input to the detailed design specification (and was anyway a rough copy of the Devil\'s Gate bridge produced by the NSW Works Department), Bradfield subsequently attempted to claim personal credit for Dorman Long\'s design. This led to a bitter argument, with Dorman Long maintaining that instructing other people to produce a copy of an existing design in a document not subsequently used to specify the final construction did not constitute personal design input on Bradfield\'s part. This friction ultimately led to a large contemporary brass plaque being bolted very tightly to the side of one of the granite columns of the bridge to makes things clear.[40]\n\nThe official ceremony to mark the turning of the first sod occurred on 28 July 1923, on the spot at Milsons Point where two workshops to assist in building the bridge were to be constructed.[41][42]\n\nAn estimated 469 buildings on the north shore, both private homes and commercial operations, were demolished to allow construction to proceed, with little or no compensation being paid. Work on the bridge itself commenced with the construction of approaches and approach spans, and by September 1926 concrete piers to support the approach spans were in place on each side of the harbour.[41]\n\nAs construction of the approaches took place, work was also started on preparing the foundations required to support the enormous weight of the arch and loadings. Concrete and granite faced abutment towers were constructed, with the angled foundations built into their sides.[41]\n\nOnce work had progressed sufficiently on the support structures, a giant creeper crane was erected on each side of the harbour.[43] These cranes were fitted with a cradle, and then used to hoist men and materials into position to allow for erection of the steelwork. To stabilise works while building the arches, tunnels were excavated on each shore with steel cables passed through them and then fixed to the upper sections of each half-arch to stop them collapsing as they extended outwards.[41]\n\nArch construction itself began on 26 October 1928. The southern end of the bridge was worked on ahead of the northern end, to detect any errors and to help with alignment. The cranes would \"creep\" along the arches as they were constructed, eventually meeting up in the middle. In less than two years, on 19 August 1930, the two halves of the arch touched for the first time. Workers riveted both top and bottom sections of the arch together, and the arch became self-supporting, allowing the support cables to be removed. On 20 August 1930 the joining of the arches was celebrated by flying the flags of Australia and the United Kingdom from the jibs of the creeper cranes.[41][44]', 'A similar ribbon-cutting ceremony on the bridge\'s northern side by North Sydney\'s mayor, Alderman Primrose, was carried out without incident. It was later discovered that Primrose was also a New Guard member but his role in and knowledge of the de Groot incident, if any, are unclear.[citation needed] The pair of golden scissors used in the ribbon cutting ceremonies on both sides of the bridge was also used to cut the ribbon at the dedication of the Bayonne Bridge, which had opened between Bayonne, New Jersey, and New York City the year before.[56][57]\n\nDespite the bridge opening in the midst of the Great Depression, opening celebrations were organised by the Citizens of Sydney Organising Committee, an influential body of prominent men and politicians that formed in 1931 under the chairmanship of the lord mayor to oversee the festivities. The celebrations included an array of decorated floats, a procession of passenger ships sailing below the bridge, and a Venetian Carnival.[58] A message from a primary school in Tottenham, 515 km (320 mi) away in rural New South Wales, arrived at the bridge on the day and was presented at the opening ceremony. It had been carried all the way from Tottenham to the bridge by relays of school children, with the final relay being run by two children from the nearby Fort Street Boys\' and Girls\' schools. After the official ceremonies, the public was allowed to walk across the bridge on the deck, something that would not be repeated until the 50th anniversary celebrations.[30] Estimates suggest that between 300,000 and one million people took part in the opening festivities,[30] a phenomenal number given that the entire population of Sydney at the time was estimated to be 1,256,000.[59]\n\nThere had also been numerous preparatory arrangements. On 14 March 1932, three postage stamps were issued to commemorate the imminent opening of the bridge. Several songs were composed for the occasion.[60] In the year of the opening, there was a steep rise in babies being named Archie and Bridget in honour of the bridge.[61] One of three microphones used at the opening ceremony was signed by 10 local dignitaries who officiated at the event, Philip Game, John Lang, MA Davidson, Samuel Walder, D Clyne, H Primrose, Ben Howe, John Bradfield, Lawrence Ennis and Roland Kitson. It was supplied by Amalgamated Wireless Australasia, who organised the ceremony\'s broadcast and collected by Philip Geeves, the AWA announcer on the day. The radio is now in the collection of the Powerhouse Museum.[62]\n\nThe bridge itself was regarded as a triumph over Depression times, earning the nickname \"the Iron Lung\", as it kept many Depression-era workers employed.[63]', NULL, '../../assets/images/2023-02/syndey-harbour-bridge-1.jpg', 'Antarctica', 'Steel', 'Through arch', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3313.4496152345955!2d151.2085930513767!3d-33.85230182554044!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b12ae5d25ead5e3%3A0x68948eb717c0c43e!2sSydney%20Harbour%20Bridge!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1678193022496!5m2!1sen!2s'),

The current crossing, which opened to traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel. It replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, which in turn superseded a 600-year-old stone-built medieval structure. This was preceded by a succession of timber bridges, the first of which was built by the Roman founders of London.\n\nThe current bridge stands at the western end of the Pool of London and is positioned 30 metres (98 ft) upstream from previous alignments. The approaches to the medieval bridge were marked by the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr on the northern bank and by Southwark Cathedral on the southern shore. Until Putney Bridge opened in 1729, London Bridge was the only road crossing of the Thames downstream of Kingston upon Thames. London Bridge has been depicted in its several forms, in art, literature, and songs, including the nursery rhyme \"London Bridge Is Falling Down\", and the epic poem The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot.\n\nThe modern bridge is owned and maintained by Bridge House Estates, an independent charity of medieval origin overseen by the City of London Corporation. It carries the A3 road, which is maintained by the Greater London Authority.[1] The crossing also delineates an area along the southern bank of the River Thames, between London Bridge and Tower Bridge, that has been designated as a business improvement district.[2]', 'The abutments of modern London Bridge rest several metres above natural embankments of gravel, sand and clay. From the late Neolithic era the southern embankment formed a natural causeway above the surrounding swamp and marsh of the river\'s estuary; the northern ascended to higher ground at the present site of Cornhill. Between the embankments, the River Thames could have been crossed by ford when the tide was low, or ferry when it was high. Both embankments, particularly the northern, would have offered stable beachheads for boat traffic up and downstream – the Thames and its estuary were a major inland and Continental trade route from at least the 9th century BC.[3]\n\nThere is archaeological evidence for scattered Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlement nearby, but until a bridge was built there, London did not exist.[4] A few miles upstream, beyond the river\'s upper tidal reach, two ancient fords were in use. These were apparently aligned with the course of Watling Street, which led into the heartlands of the Catuvellauni, Britain\'s most powerful tribe at the time of Caesar\'s invasion of 54 BC. Some time before Claudius\'s conquest of AD 43, power shifted to the Trinovantes, who held the region northeast of the Thames Estuary from a capital at Camulodunum, nowadays Colchester in Essex. Claudius imposed a major colonia at Camulodunum, and made it the capital city of the new Roman province of Britannia. The first London Bridge was built by the Romans as part of their road-building programme, to help consolidate their conquest.[5]', 'After the murder of his former friend and later opponent Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, the penitent King Henry II commissioned a new stone bridge in place of the old, with a chapel at its centre dedicated to Becket as martyr. The archbishop had been a native Londoner, born at Cheapside, and a popular figure. The Chapel of St Thomas on the Bridge became the official start of pilgrimage to his Canterbury shrine; it was grander than some town parish churches, and had an additional river-level entrance for fishermen and ferrymen. Building work began in 1176, supervised by Peter of Colechurch.[13] The costs would have been enormous; Henry\'s attempt to meet them with taxes on wool and sheepskins probably gave rise to a later legend that London Bridge was built on wool packs.[13] In 1202, before Colechurch\'s death, Isembert, a French monk who was renowned as a bridge builder, was appointed by King John to complete the project. Construction was not finished until 1209. There were houses on the bridge from the start; this was a normal way of paying for the maintenance of a bridge, though in this case it had to be supplemented by other rents and by tolls. From 1282 two bridge wardens were responsible for maintaining the bridge, heading the organization known as the Bridge House. The only two collapses occurred when maintenance had been neglected, in 1281 (five arches) and 1437 (two arches). In 1212, perhaps the greatest of the early fires of London broke out, spreading as far as the chapel and trapping many people.\n\nThe bridge was about 926 feet (282 metres) long, and had nineteen piers linked by nineteen arches and a wooden drawbridge. There were \'starlings\' around the piers to protect them (they had deeper piles than the piers themselves). The bridge, including the part occupied by houses, was from 20 to 24 feet (6.1 to 7.3 metres) wide. The roadway was mostly around 15 feet (4.6 metres) wide, varying from about 14 feet to 16 feet, except that it was narrower at defensive features (the stone gate, the drawbridge and the drawbridge tower) and wider south of the stone gate. The houses occupied only a few feet on each side of the bridge. They received their main support either from the piers, which extended well beyond the bridge itself from west to east, or from \'hammer beams\' laid from pier to pier parallel to the bridge. It was the length of the piers which made it possible to build quite large houses, up to 34 feet (10 metres) deep.[14]\n\nThe numerous starlings restricted the river\'s tidal ebb and flow. The difference in water levels on the two sides of the bridge could be as much as 6 feet (1.8 m), producing ferocious rapids between the piers resembling a weir.[15] Only the brave or foolhardy attempted to \"shoot the bridge\" – steer a boat between the starlings when in flood – and some were drowned in the attempt. The bridge was \"for wise men to pass over, and for fools to pass under.\"[16] The restricted flow also meant that in hard winters the river upstream was more susceptible to freezing.\n\nThe number of houses on the bridge reached its maximum in the late fourteenth century, when there were 140. Subsequently, many of the houses, originally only 10 to 11 feet wide, were merged, so that by 1605 there were 91. Originally they are likely to have had only two storeys, but they were gradually enlarged. In the seventeenth century, when there are detailed descriptions of them, almost all had four or five storeys (counting the garrets as a storey); three houses had six storeys. Two-thirds of the houses were rebuilt from 1477 to 1548. In the seventeenth century, the usual plan was a shop on the ground floor, a hall and often a chamber on the first floor, a kitchen and usually a chamber and a waterhouse (for hauling up water in buckets) on the second floor, and chambers and garrets above. Approximately every other house shared in a \'cross building\' above the roadway, linking the houses either side and extending from the first floor upwards.[17]', 'For nearly twenty years only sheds replaced the burnt buildings. They were replaced In the 1680s, when almost all the houses on the bridge were rebuilt. The roadway was widened to 20 feet (6.1 metres) by setting the houses further back and was increased in height from one storey to two. The new houses extended further back over the river, which was to cause trouble later. In 1695 the bridge had 551 inhabitants. From 1670 attempts were made to keep traffic in each direction to one side, at first through a keep-right policy and from 1722 through a keep-left policy.[26] This has been suggested as one possible origin for the practice of traffic in Britain driving on the left.[27]\n\nA fire in September 1725 destroyed all the houses south of the stone gate; they were rebuilt.[28] The last houses to be built on the bridge were designed by George Dance the Elder in 1745,[29] but these buildings had begun to subside within a decade.[30] In 1756, the London Bridge Act gave the City Corporation the power to purchase all the properties on the bridge so that they could be demolished and the bridge improved. While this work was underway, a temporary wooden bridge was constructed to the west of London Bridge. It opened in October 1757 but caught fire and collapsed in the following April. The old bridge was reopened until a new wooden construction could be completed a year later.[31] To help improve navigation under the bridge, its two centre arches were replaced by a single wider span, the Great Arch, in 1759.\n\nDemolition of the houses was completed in 1761 and the last tenant departed after some 550 years of housing on the bridge.[32] Under the supervision of Dance the Elder, the roadway was widened to 46 feet (14 m)[33] and a balustrade was added \"in the Gothic taste\" together with fourteen stone alcoves for pedestrians to shelter in.[34] However, the creation of the Great Arch had weakened the rest of the structure and constant expensive repairs were required in the following decades; this, combined with congestion both on and under bridge, often leading to fatal accidents, resulted in public pressure for a modern replacement.[35]', NULL, '../../assets/images/2023-02/london-bridge-1.jpg', 'Europe', 'Steel', 'Box girder', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2483.288961213638!2d-0.08992169845623375!3d51.507914468386296!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x4876035159bb13c5%3A0xa61e28267c3563ac!2sLondon%20Bridge!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1678193235602!5m2!1sen!2s'),

The bridge was designed by CCSHCC Second Highway Consultants Company, Limited. and built at a cost of 720 million yuan (approximately US$100 million). It opened to traffic on November 15, 2009.  The bridge is part of the new G50 Huyu Expressway that parallels China National Highway 318, an east-west route between Shanghai and Chongqing, crossing the wide belt of mountains that separate the Sichuan Basin from the lowlands of eastern Hubei. The Yangtze River pierces the same mountain belt 50 km (31 mi) to the north, forming the famous Three Gorges. The Yiwan Railway, completed in 2010 and running parallel to the highway, has been described as China\'s most difficult to build and most expensive (per km) rail line. The bridge spans a 500-meter-deep (1,600 ft) valley of the Sidu River (a left tributary of the Qingjiang River), and superseded the Royal Gorge Bridge and the Beipan River Guanxing Highway Bridge as the highest bridge in the world until it in turn was surpassed by the Duge Bridge in 2016.', 'The bridge\'s design includes H-shaped towers, a truss- stiffened main span, and unsuspended side spans.

Conditions at the bridge\'s location would not allow the use of boats or helicopters, which have previously been used to string the first cable. The rockets carried the pilot cables across on October 6, 2006 and resulted in time and cost savings.', 'The 10 highest of China’s many high bridges were all built after 2000 and are located primarily in the 3 western Provinces of Guizhou, Hubei and Chongqing. All 10 of these bridges exceed 1,300 feet (400 meters) in height and dominate the world’s 10 highest while four have held the world record for highest road or rail bridge. Even more amazing, 50 Chinese bridges are now higher than Colorado’s Royal Gorge, the former world’s highest bridge from 1929 to 2001.\n\nIt would only be appropriate that the second highest suspension bridge in the world is also on one of the greatest bridge “high-ways” in the world. Stretching 300 miles (483 km) from Yichang and the 3 Gorges dam in the east to the city of Zhongxian in the west, this 4-lane engineering marvel has more than half a dozen spectacular bridges that exceed 500 feet (150 meters) in height including Zhijinghe, formerly the highest roadway arch bridge in the world. This more direct route bypasses one of the toughest and most mountainous stretches of the Yangtze River. What once took more than a day of travel on dangerous mountain roads or a Yangtze river boat can now be safely traversed in 5 hours along the G50 Expressway.\n\nThe success of the route also owes as much to the construction of the numerous tunnels that punch through dozens of towering peaks that blocked the highway’s path. One of the more impressive of these tunnels leads to the east end of the Siduhe bridge and makes for one of the world’s more dramatic bridge introductions.\n\nWith a span of 900 meters / 2,952 feet, Siduhe bridge is a fairly typical long span Chinese suspension bridge with H-frame concrete towers, a truss stiffened road deck and unsuspended side spans. One aspect of its construction that was not so ordinary relates to its extreme height. Due to the remote, inaccessible river canyon, the engineers decided to experiment and instead of using a blimp or helicopter to drag the first pilot line across the gorge, they would use a rocket. Over 3,281 feet (1000 meter) of tether was attached to the back end of a 4 foot (1.5 mtr) long rocket and blasted across the deep river gorge. Also unusual is the termination of the east end bridge cables into a long tunnel foundation deep under the steep slope of the mountain', 'The Warren truss has a depth of 6.5 meters and a width of 26 meters. Each truss section measures 6.4 meters. The entire structure is supported by concrete towers 113.6 and 118.2 meters tall.\n\nSiduhe is so high that its closest foreign rival in Mexico is over 100 meters lower. It is 672 feet (205 meters) higher than Colorado’s Royal Gorge bridge. The structure also has the unique distinction of being the first bridge in the world where a person falling from the deck can reach terminal velocity - the speed at which a falling object will no longer accelerate. With so many unprecedented superlatives, the Siduhe River bridge retained its world\'s highest suspension bridge status for 16 years before it was surpassed in 2025 by the Beipanjiang Huajiang Bridge in Guizhou Province.\n\nSiduhe translates to Four Crossings River. “Si” means four while “du” means crossings and “he” means river. The name probably came from the Red Army’s famous Four Crossings of the Chishui River in Guizhou Province during Chairman Mao Tse Tung’s Long March in 1935.\n\nA trip along the G50 expressway to Siduhe bridge is a truly spectacular experience as you will be treated to an assortment of huge bridges of every size and variety. West of Siduhe there is the Zhijinghe bridge, the world’s highest roadway arch that soars 965 feet (294 meters) above the river gorge. East of the bridge there is the incredible parade of 200 meter high monsters including the Tieluoping cable stayed bridge, the Shuanghekou beam bridge and finally the Longtanhe viaduct - a multi span concrete beam bridge that is one of the world’s 20 largest and highest beam bridge viaducts.', NULL, '../../assets/images/2023-02/sidu-river-bridge-1.jpg', 'Asia', 'Steel', 'Suspension', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3433.5144967947954!2d110.3981129510936!3d30.61945459804358!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3684fe9f32fc7e75%3A0x679a69ea236b0b84!2sSidu%20River%20Bridge!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1678193746235!5m2!1sen!2s'),

No efforts to dig them up were undertaken by Wurster and Ganzert. Only two of the 28 arches were exposed enough so that direct measurements of the clear span and the pier width could be undertaken. It was, however, possible to calculate the dimensions of the remaining bays from their exposed sections.\r\n\r\nOnly in a single case, between arches 26 and 27, were Wurster and Ganzert able to determine the breadth of a pier: 2.10 m (6.9 ft).

The inaccessible terrain on the east and west slopes along Puli Creek made it difficult for the bridge engineers to create an exact topographic model of the bottom of the Puli Creek canyon and once rock stability was ensured near the towers there was little need for them to find out how far down the elevation of the creek was. In 2014 I was able to measure the height from the construction catwalk of the main cables confirming a vertical drop of 485 meters. With the center of the span at around 1,828 meters, the bottom of the nearby Gexiang River Gorge is approximately 600 meters lower at around 1,228 meters elevation.', 'The main span of 628 meters is unique among China\'s highest suspension bridges in that it has a thin, steel box deck girder instead of the usual truss.

The towers have a maximum height of 156.5 meters supporting two main cables composed of 91 full-length cable strands. The steel box girder is an orthotropic design with a width of 28.5 metes and a depth of 3 meters. The thickness of the steel plate on the deck is 16mm while the bottom plate is 10mm thick.

The local topography is dominated by the foothills of the Toçak Dağı mountains, which blend here with the alluvial bottomlands of the Bay of Finike. In this transitional area, the bridge was built immediately above the point where the narrow river valley opens into the wide estuary plain, and where the crossing of the river during the rain period would be obstructed by high water. While the eastern end of the bridge levels off at the gravel plain, the western end abuts directly to the rising rock wall of the mountain, presumably for protection against floods. The resulting sharp bend in the course of the road could also be exploited in case of need to block the road. A modern dam, Alakır Barajı, was constructed upstream for irrigation purposes and flood protection.\r\n\r\nLycia did not, in contrast to other Roman provinces, possess a very developed road system. While the north–south traffic was conducted primarily through the few river valleys, the east–west routes led, unlike today, mostly on and along the mountain ridges. This particular road, leading from Limyra over the Alakır Çayı and into the neighbouring region of Pamphylia and Attaleia, must have been of special importance, since the two regions were united in a single province, Lycia et Pamphylia, until the 4th century. In comparison to the main arterial roads of the Roman Empire however, the roads of Lycia were, with 3–4 m (9.8–13.1 ft) width, rather modest and confined to pedestrian and pack animal traffic. This is further corroborated by the fact that no wagon ruts are evident on the paving of the Limyra bridge, nor any traces of a parapet or breastwork.', 'With a length of 360 m (1,181.1 ft), the Limyra Bridge qualifies as the largest surviving engineering achievement of antiquity in Lycia. The bridge stands on 26 uniform segmental arches consisting of a double, radially laid course of bricks. At the eastern end, the original 27th arch has been replaced by two smaller, semicircular arches of later construction. The latter are built with a single course of bricks. Traces of the original, flat beginning of the collapsed arch are still visible on the piers.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Wurster\'s and Ganzert\'s visit to the site, the entire bridge was buried by river sediments up to the springing line of the vaults. No efforts to dig them up were undertaken by Wurster and Ganzert. Only two of the 28 arches were exposed enough so that direct measurements of the clear span and the pier width could be undertaken. It was, however, possible to calculate the dimensions of the remaining bays from their exposed sections.\r\n\r\nOnly in a single case, between arches 26 and 27, were Wurster and Ganzert able to determine the breadth of a pier: 2.10 m (6.9 ft). Subtracting this value from the common arch span of 12.75 m (41.8 ft), a clear span of 10.65 m (34.9 ft) remains. Since all arches have a rise of ca. 2 m (6.6 ft), the Limyra Bridge has an unusually large span-to-rise ratio of 5.3 to 1. Such flattened arches were very rare at the time for stone bridges, and were not matched and surpassed.', 'The way the arches of the bridge were built gives the bridge an unusually flat profile, which was unique in Roman engineering at the time. Due to this fact and the lack of comparable structures, it has been hard to date the construction of the bride, which is estimated to be sometime in the 3rd century. Additionally, very little scientific research has been conducted on the bridge and there is no information about the bridge from ancient sources.', NULL, '../../assets/images/2023-02/bridge-near-limyra-1.jpg', 'Europe', 'Brick', 'Through arch', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3213.4929425323444!2d30.20535885119376!3d36.34883710057732!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x14c226e199219aa7%3A0x35a5f62b95e5d70f!2sBridge%20near%20Limyra!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1678193846508!5m2!1sen!2s'),

On March 10, 1683, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a law requiring the building of bridges across all of the rivers and creeks along all of the King\'s Highway in Pennsylvania, from the Falls of the Delaware (at Trenton, N.J.) to the southernmost ports of Sussex County (now part of the state of Delaware).\r\n\r\nThe bridges, which were to be completed within 18 months, were to be ten feet wide and include railings along each side. The areas on either side of the bridges were to be cleared to facilitate horse and cart traffic. Each bridge was to be built by male inhabitants of the surrounding area; those who failed to appear were to be fined 20 shillings.\r\n\r\nPlumer arranged with a cargo shipping company that was going to sail a newly built ship, without any cargo, from the U.K. to the U.S. Plumer negotiated to pay for all the voyage\'s operating costs, in return for carrying the bridge stones as cargo to the U.S., which was far less than the going rate shipping costs.\r\n\r\nIn 1970, the bridge earned an award by the American Society of Civil Engineers, Philadelphia Section, as an outstanding engineering achievement and a historic civil engineering landmark. A bronze plaque was placed on the western parapet in commemoration.', 'This bridge was built in the heart of the colonial era, about 16 years after William Penn had been granted the land for granted the land for the Pennsylvania Colony by King Charles II, and the idea of a United States was not even a thought at the time.

Named after the nearby St. Peter\'s Chapel, the bridge is unique in containing a number of interior paintings dating back to the 17th century, although many of them were destroyed along with a larger part of the centuries-old bridge in a 1993 fire. Subsequently restored, the Kapellbrücke is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe, as well as the world\'s oldest surviving truss bridge. It serves as the city\'s symbol and as one of Switzerland\'s main tourist attractions.', 'Kapellbrücke crosses the Reuss River, where it meets Lake Lucerne, connecting the Altstadt or old city of Lucerne in Switzerland to its more modern counterpart. The covered, wooden bridge, with its distinctive red tiled roof, is one of Switzerland’s major tourist attractions and has been in existence since around 1333.\n\nFifty minutes after midnight, on August 18th, 1993, fire services were called to the bridge by a tourist who reported that a fire on a boat under the bridge had spread to the Kapellbrücke itself. With Swiss efficiency, the fire was under control by 1.15 a.m. though a fire watch was kept for another eleven hours during which small fires, which reignited from the smouldering embers, were quickly quenched. There were no fatalities.\n\nThe Kapellbrücke is thought to be the oldest surviving truss bridge in the world and was built as part of the medieval defences of the city. The octagonal, 34 metre high water tower, built around 1300, was integrated into the bridge and served variously as a prison, a dungeon, a torture chamber, a shop and is now an archive. The northern bridgehead once led directly into St. Peter’s Chapel, which in turn gave the bridge its name, but today this section of the bridge is a lakeside promenade.Covering the bridge with a roof and sides helped to protect it from the extremes of weather through the centuries, while its structural strength is visibly based on that of the triangle. In the early 17th century the city council paid artist Hans Wegmann and his sons to paint the triangular spaces between the rafters with scenes from the lives of St. Leger and St. Maurice, the patron saints of Lucerne and scenes from Swiss history.The bridge has undergone restoration and reconstruction in its long history, notably after a flood swept part of it away in 1741. The fire of August 1993 destroyed the unique gabled roof and the bridge balustrades, leaving only the substructure of the 204 metre long bridge, the bridge heads and the pillars on which to reconstruct a new bridge. Many of Wegmann’s paintings were also destroyed though it was possible to restore thirty.\n\nForensics revealed that the fire, thought by the tourist who alerted the fire authorities to have started on the boat, actually ignited on the bridge itself, possibly due to a discarded cigarette smouldering in the timbers.

A method of bypassing Millau had long been considered, not only to ease the flow and reduce journey times for long-distance traffic, but also to improve the quality of access to Millau for its local businesses and residents. One of the solutions considered was the construction of a road bridge span the river and gorge valley.[10] The first plans for a bridge were discussed in 1987 by CETE, and by October 1991 the decision was made to build a high crossing of the Tarn by a structure of around 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) in length. During 1993–1994, the government consulted with seven architects and eight structural engineers. During 1995–1996, a second definition study was made by five associated architect groups and structural engineers. In January 1995, the government issued a declaration of public interest to solicit design approaches for a competition.[11]\n\nIn July 1996 the jury decided in favour of a cable-stayed design with multiple spans, as proposed by the SODETEG consortium led by Michel Virlogeux, Norman Foster and Arcadis.[12][13] The decision to proceed by grant of contract was made in May 1998; then in June 2000, the contest for the construction contract was launched, open to four consortia.

Several projects were considered over the following decades. In 1551, the authorities requested proposals for the renewal of the Rialto Bridge, among other things. Plans were offered by famous architects, such as Jacopo Sansovino, Palladio and Vignola, but all involved a Classical approach with several arches, which was judged inappropriate to the situation. Michelangelo also was considered as designer of the bridge.[3]\n\nThe present stone bridge, a single span designed by Antonio da Ponte, began to be constructed in 1588 and was completed in 1591.[3] It is similar to the wooden bridge it succeeded. Two ramps lead up to a central portico. On either side of the portico, the covered ramps carry rows of shops.

Using concrete reduced material costs and allowed more of the total cost to be paid to workers, which was a positive aspect of the design during the Depression. They chose concrete in part because it would not only reduce both construction and maintenance costs but would also echo the color and composition of the natural rock cliff formations in the area.\n\nThe state awarded a contract for $203,334 to the lower bidder, Ward Engineering Company of San Francisco, on August 13, 1931.

In 1912 the Nyasaland government agreed to give financial assistance to British South Africa Company to build the 98-kilometre (61 mi) Central African Railway from Nsanje, the southern terminus of the Shire Highlands Railway to the north bank of the Zambezi at Chindio. This line was completed in 1914 and, at first, river steamers went from Chindio to Chinde on the Indian Ocean. From Chinde, the sea-going lighters continued to Beira, Mozambique. It took two to three weeks to move goods from Blantyre to Beira, involved three transhipments and exposed goods to the risk of water damage.\r\nIn 1922, the Trans-Zambezia Railway Company completed a line from Beira to Murracca on the Zambezi, opposite Chindio, so there was an almost-complete rail link from Blantyre to Beira except for the short river crossing by ferry. This was inconvenient because the capacity of the ferry depended on the river depth. For two months in the dry season, the river was low and wet-season floods often washed parts of the track away. In 1927, the British government commissioned a report on building a Zambezi bridge.', 'Dona Ana bridge, which spans the Zambezi River between the village of Nhamayabwe in Tete and Caia in Sofala province, is getting its first facelift in the 86 years since it was built.\r\n\r\nThe works, which are scheduled over 90 days, started on Tuesday and are budgeted at eight million meticais [around US$135 thousand at current exchange rates], at the expense of Mozambique Railways (CFM) and Electricity of Mozambique (EDM).\r\n\r\nWork will consist of replacing the metal sheets of the pavement, replacing profiles at various points, stripping and repainting, and replacing more than 100 street lamps across the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe Dona Ana bridge was built on the section of the Sena railway line connecting Beira to the village of Moatize, and is approximately 3,700 metres long, of which 565 metres is supported by the Sena viaduct, 2,990 metres is carried on the central bridge and the remaining 265 metres by the viaduct on the Mutarara side.', 'The bridge was built by the Nyasaland Army and natives under the Engineering company of Cleveland Bridges of UK from July 1929 to March 1935.\r\nSir Armstrong Whitfield and Frederick Handman awarded CBE later took charge of the work over the bridge.\r\nNyasaland soldiers from WWI and Nyasaland natives toiled over years building this structure that dazzled the whole world in decades to come.\r\nSo many Nyasas lost their lives in building this Magnificent Bridge which became Nyaslands single super contribution to the modern world', NULL, '../../assets/images/2023-03/dona-ana-bridge-1.jpg', 'Africa', 'Steel', 'Other', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3369.344703557207!2d-106.82611094887756!3d32.38312031117835!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x86de3904d0bb870b%3A0xcc654ca06b185b1!2sDona%20Ana%20Rd%2C%20Las%20Cruces%2C%20NM%2088007%2C%20USA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1678195379688!5m2!1sen!2s'),

As the river forms the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia, the bridge links the two countries and has border posts on the approaches to both ends, at the towns of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, and Livingstone, Zambia.', 'The bridge was the brainchild of Cecil Rhodes, part of his grand and unfulfilled Cape to Cairo railway scheme, even though he never visited the falls and died before construction of the bridge began. Rhodes is recorded as instructing the engineers to \"build the bridge across the Zambezi where the trains, as they pass, will catch the spray of the Falls\". It was designed by George Andrew Hobson of consultants Sir Douglas Fox and Partners, assisted by the stress calculations of Ralph Freeman, who was later the principal designer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The main central arch is a parabolic curve.\r\n\r\nThe bridge was prefabricated in England by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company,before being shipped to the port city of Beira in Portuguese-ruled Mozambique, and then transported on the newly constructed railway to the Victoria Falls. It took just 14 months to construct and was completed in 1905.\r\n\r\nThe bridge was officially opened by Professor Sir George Darwin, son of Charles Darwin and President of the British Association (now the British Science Association), on 12 September 1905. The American Society of Civil Engineers has designated the bridge as an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.', 'The bridge consists of three spans. The end span on the left bank of the river is 62 feet 6 inches, and that on the other bank 87 feet 6 inches. These spans are composed of braced girders of ordinary type, 12 feet 6 inches deep, with horizontal upper and lower chords, and divided into square panels. The girders are fixed 20 feet apart. Connected with the end posts of the central span, they unite it with each bank of the river in a direct and simple manner. The deck is horizontal, and is laid on the top chords throughout the bridge... The cross girders, spaced 12 feet 6 inches apart, rest on the top chord.\r\nThe central span is 500 feet from centre to centre of bearings, with a rise of 90 feet. The curvature of the arched rib is parabolic. The panels, twenty in number, are 25 feet in length. The depth of the girder at the crown is 15 feet, and at the abutment 105 feet. Each main girder stands in a plane at an inclination of 1 in 8 from the perpendicular. The width between the centres of the girders is 27 feet 6 inches at the top, and 53 feet 9 inches at the springing level, and the width between the parapets 30 feet. There is a camber of 9 inches in the top chord.', 'The Victoria Falls Bridge is a steel arch bridge designed by George Andrew Hobson of the consulting firm Sir Douglas Fox and Partners.

The steel arch has a span of 156.50 meters (513 feet) and is suspended on two piers, each of which is 46 meters (151 feet) high.\r\n\r\nThe bridge was designed to carry a single railway track, but it is now also used for road traffic and pedestrians. It is considered to be a remarkable feat of engineering for its time, and it is still in use today as an important transportation link between Zambia and Zimbabwe.

In 1989, the World Bank financed the urbanisation plan for Maputo, which included the construction of a bridge.\r\nIt was only thanks to the end of the civil war, the numerous investments in the course of the gas and oil boom and the associated strong economic upturn in Mozambique that the Mozambican government was able to tackle the project. The government opened an expression of interest procedure in November 2008.\r\n\r\nFollowing a visit by the then Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates in 2010, financing by the Portuguese state was originally planned. However, due to the country\'s massive financial and budgetary crisis, the commitment could not be fulfilled. After a visit by Mozambican President Armando Guebuza to the People\'s Republic of China in August 2011, both countries agreed on financing of the project by China.', 'The four-lane suspension bridge is 3041 metres long and crosses the bay at a height of 60 metres. The northern viaduct (foreland bridge) is 1097 meters long, approximately S-shaped and is connected to the Praça 16 de Junho roundabout (connected to the EN1/EN2/EN4 highways) in the Maputo neighborhood of Malanga. The southern viaduct is 1264 meters long and consists of precast elements. It is directly connected to the road to Ponta do Ouro.\r\n\r\nOriginally, pylons were also planned in the bay itself, but they were removed after a change of plan so as not to unnecessarily obstruct shipping traffic. A span of 680 metres is bridged without pillars between the two pylons located on the banks. This makes the bridge the largest of its kind in Africa. The main supporting cables are each connected to a solid anchor block via steel structures in the north and south. The extremely high loads of the structure required pile foundations with diameters of 1.50 m to 2.20 m. The piles reach 110 m deep into the claystone. The two pylons are 141 m high, and at a height of about 40 meters there is a crossbar for the roadway. The individual prefabricated steel elements for the carriageway are 25.60 m wide and 12 m long. These were fabricated in China and installed from a ship lying near the quay wall.', 'The Maputo–Katembe Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Maputo Bay in Mozambique, connecting the cities of Maputo on the north bank and Katembe on the south bank.
